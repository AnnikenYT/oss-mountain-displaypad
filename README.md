# Open Source Support for the Mountain DisplayPad

This repository provides a Python driver for the Mountain DisplayPad, enabling users to control and customize their DisplayPad devices on various operating systems.

This was built on the amazing work of [ReversingForFun in their DisplayPad project](https://github.com/ReversingForFun/MountainDisplayPadPy/tree/main).

## Features

This Repository contains two modules:
- `displaypad_driver`: A low-level driver for communicating with the Mountain DisplayPad via USB.
- `displaypad`: A higher-level interface that simplifies common tasks such as setting images and managing device states.
